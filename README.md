## Machine learning Sensor Project

A Python-based web application that detects whether sensors are functioning normally or showing faults using Machine Learning techniques.

Built with Flask, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for backend processing and prediction.

1. **Setup Virtual Environment**:
   - Open the terminal.
   - Install the virtual environment package if you haven't already
   - Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
    conda activate venv/


2. **Install Requirements**:
   - Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Running the Project Locally**

1.Launch the Flask application:

python app.py

2.Open your browser and go to:

4. **Let's Deploy it at Render.com**:
   -go to this website: https://dashboard.render.com/web
   -then click on new and choose web serivces
   -choose this :Build and deploy from a Git repository and click on next
   -then in settings :![image](<"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2193f75-6aa5-49f5-ba19-f785251de441")


6. **So click on manual Deploy and select deploy with latest commit**
   -and wait 2-3 mint after that your website will be published.
